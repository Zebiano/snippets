# Trimmed version of the pointerlock controls file

This is basically a file containing only the controls part of [Pointerlock Controls](https://threejs.org/examples/misc_controls_pointerlock.html) for Three.js. If you are planning on implementing a 1st person game for three.js, here's a way to start!

I didn't add any components, I've only removed some from the base example: all the code responsible for the cube generation and the world.

#### If you are just starting out with PLC, I have a "small" tutorial (as well as some tips and tricks) on how to use/implement it in a project [here](https://github.com/Zebiano/projeto_SG)!
