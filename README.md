# snippets
Here you will find all the snippets I've developed, in hopes of helping others out with the start!

My goal is to create a neverending archive with ready to use projects. I consider these 'snippets' the base of any project, the things you will need 100% for sure for that specific project. I'll try my best to document everything correctly!

Usually the structure will be folder/core/what_you_want
